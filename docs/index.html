		<h1>Haiti Medical Records System</h1>
		<img src="images/pat-summary.png" alt="MRS Software Screenshot" width="400" />
		
		<p>This lightweight system is designed to be used to track basic medical
		records for clinics in areas with very little resources or infrastructure.
		It was originally designed and built for use in Haiti.</p>
		<p>Currently, several churches in the <a href="http://www.gracenetwork.org">Grace
		Network</a> use this system, in parternship with community health workers
		from <a href="http://www.vwazennou.org">Vwazen Nou</a> to conduct medical clinics
		for communities around Port-au-Prince several times a year. Please 
		contact <a href="mailto:haiti.mrs@gmail.com">haiti.mrs@gmail.com</a>
		with any questions.</p>
		
		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>The system contains the following components:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The medical records software itself, available for Windows and Mac, that runs on Java.</li>
			<li>The database file that stores the medical records.</li>
			<li>The paper forms used by the health care providers when prescribing treatments for a patient.</li>
			<li>The directive stickers used to instruct the patients on how to take the medicines.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>1. Medical Records Software</h1>
		<p>Download and run the following executables to run the latest version
		of the software:<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="HaitiMRS-win64.exe">Windows </a> (24 MB)</li>
			<li><a href="HaitiMRS-win32.exe">Windows (32-bit)</a> (24 MB)</li>
			<li><a href="HaitiMRS-mac.app.zip">Mac OSX</a> (22 MB)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The only prerequisite is that you have Java 8 or later installed on
		the computer. Note that Windows may be a 64-bit, but the installed version
		of Java may be 32-bit.</p>
		<p>When the program first starts, it tries to find the database file used
		to store the records. It will prompt you to identify the folder containing
		a valid database file:<br/>
		<img src="images/data-folder.png" alt="Image of data path selection dialog" /><br/>
		Use this dialog to select the directory containing the database file
		<strong>master.db</strong> (<em>see next section</em>).</p>
		
		<h1>2. Database File</h1>
		<p>The medical records are stored in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>
		database file on each computer that is running the software. You can
		download a template database file here:<p>
		<p><a href="master.db">master.db</a> (1 MB)</p>
		<p>This file is mostly blank, but contains a snapshot of the FDA's formulary
		as well as some commonly used "standard" prescriptions (to facilitate
		fast entry of some of the most common and/or least complex prescriptions).
		Once you have downloaded this file, select the folder to which you 
		downloaded the file when you first start the program (<em>see above</em>).</p>
		<p>The simplest way to use this system is with a single computer writing
		and reading records from this file. However, the system is designed to
		also be used across multiple computers concurrently. When the program
		starts, it copies the master database file to a folder that is unique
		to the computer and the computer's user. In this way, many computers
		can be editing the data in their own copies of the database without 
		affecting the master file (and without requiring an Internet connection).
		However, you will eventually need to push the changes of a given
		copy back up to the master so that it can be viewable by everyone else.</p>
		<p>To publish or push a user's changes back to the master file, download
		the following two files and run the executable:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="HaitiMRS-admin.exe">Merge Tool (Windows)</a> (17MB)</li>
			<li><a href="logback.xml">Merge Tool Logging Configuration</a> (1 KB)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This tool finds any changes to the data compared to the master, and
		replicates and saves those changes in the master file, as well as doing
		some data clean up, like removing duplicates. The details of what this
		tool does are out of the scope of this document, so please contact
		<a href="mailto:haiti.mrs@gmail.com">haiti.mrs@gmail.com</a> with any questions.</p>
		<p>We recommend using a file-syncing service like <strong>Dropbox</strong>,
		<strong>Box</strong>, <strong>SugarSync</strong>, or <strong>Google Drive</strong>
		to share, as well as back up, these database files. This allows the
		person who is managing the database files and running the merge tool
		to automatically receive everyone's changes in their copies of the
		database the next time each computer can connect to the Internet.
		<p>Please note that this file is not password protected and this system
		does not have any access restrictions to any information stored within it.</p>
		
		<h1>3. Patient and Prescription Forms</h1>
		<p>The software is designed to be used with printed forms for use during
		a clinic that capture patient information as well as the encounter
		with the provider. These forms mirror the kind of data captured by
		each screen in the software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="Patient Information Sheet 2.1.pdf">Patient Information Sheet</a> (78 KB)<br/>
			This sheet is written in Kreyol since Haitian community health
			workers are usually performing patient intake.</li>
			<li><a href="Prescription Sheet English 2.1.pdf">Prescription Sheet</a> (146 KB)<br/>
			This sheet is broken up into 5 sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Vitals and Labs. This section is also in Kreyol since Haitian
				community health workers are usually helping with vitals.</li>
				<li>Pre-Bagged Prescriptions. We found it greatly improved the
				efficiency of the clinic to standardize a few of the most common
				prescriptions. Providers could quickly prescribe with a few marks
				and they could be entered into the system with a few clicks. Use
				of this section is completely optional.</li>
				<li>Diagnosis Table. This table is a quick reference for the 
				most common diagnoses, their equivalent translation in Kreyol,
				and for a abbreviation or code that can be used in the following
				section.</li>
				<li>Prescriptions. Providers use this section to prescribe
				medicines to patients. They are grouped into sections by 
				medicine type or <em>form</em> (since instructions on how to take
				the medicine or <em>directives</em> are similar for similar types
				of medicines)</li>
				<li>Follow-up. The last section has space for any other comments
				and to indicate any follow up the patient might require.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>4. Directives</h1>
		<p>The directives are stickers that instruct patients on how to take their
		medicine. These are designed to be easily translated into any language
		(including future plans for pictorial stickers) but still easy for a
		provider to use to communicate instructions to the patient. This is
		achieved by keeping the order and type of "blanks" consistent regardless
		of the language (in this case, Kreyol). You can download the directive
		templates here (designed to print on standard 1" x 4" and 2" x 4" 
		adhesive labels):</p>

		<h1>Overview of our clinics</h1>
		<p>The following describes at a high level how this system is used in
		the clinics we run in parternship with churches in Haiti:</p>
		<p>First, Haitian community health workers check in patients into the
		clinic. They have an index (often printed on paper, or if there are
		enough computers or tablets access to the software directly) of all
		patients in the system with first name, surname, address, etc.
		They fill out Patient Information form (<em>Enformasyon Medikal</em>). 
		If the patient exists in the system, they record the patient's ID at
		the top of the form.</p>
		<p>Then, the health workers and/or American volunteers measure the vitals
		of each patient. They fill out the top section of the Prescription Sheet
		(<em>Preskripsyon</em>). This form is mainly in Kreyol, but Americans
		can use the units to know where to fill each vital. Metric or Standard
		units can be used- the software will automatically convert to metric.</p>
		<p>Then the patient is seen by the health care provider/doctor. We
		usually have American doctors working with translators, but we have also
		partnered with Haitian doctors. Providers usually have a computer with
		them running the EMR where they can quickly look up existing patients
		and the summary of their information using the patient ID. They will
		fill out the rest of the form, prescribing one or more medications.
		Each prescription consists of a standard "diagnosis code" (from the
		table at the bottom of the first page of the prescription sheet),
		a treatment/medicine with quantity/dosage, and instructions on how to
		take the medicine. Since swallowed pills are the most common, the most
		prescription "slots" are provided for those kinds of medicines, then
		chewable pills, drops/liquids, creams, and so on. These instructions
		have been standardized into "directives"- this facilitates efficient
		filling of prescriptions by laymen in the pharmacy, and easy translation
		between English and the language of the patients.</p>
		<p>The patient's prescription sheet is filled by the pharmacy- we put
		each medicine in its own Ziploc bag, and affix a sticker with that
		medicine's instructions to the bag, and then combine all the medicines
		into one large gallon-size Ziploc. Patients can receive anywhere from a
		single medication to up to about a dozen in one visit. We treat both
		acute and chronic conditions, and the chronic patients are the biggest
		reason why we implemented this EMR.</p>
		<p>Once the patient's bag of medicines have been prepared, the bag and
		the sheet are sent to the EMR/data entry. One or more people (Haitian
		and/or American) are running the software on one or more computers-
		they create new patients or update the existing patient's basic
		information from the update form, and then they add each prescription
		into the system. We find they also function as "Quality Assurance" and
		double-check the pharmacy- since they have to look up the exact medicine
		name and are seeing how many pills the patient is receiving, they can
		often catch errors or if the pharmacy forgot to fill a prescription on
		the sheet.</p>
		<p>The medicine is then given to the patient by a native Kreyol speaker
		who can go through each medicine and explain/show how to take it. Finally,
		each patient is prayed for before they leave the clinic.</p>
		<p>Our main goal is enabling our sister Haitian church to do relational
		evangelism, so every station involves both Americans and trained Haitian
		health workers that are also members of church so that it's a partnership.
		We try to make sure each patient feels that they are being cared for and
		loved by the clinic workers (both Haitian and American) with which they
		interact. But we also want to make sure the patients are receiving
		excellent care, which is why we started the EMR. Particularly for chronic
		patients (like hypertension and diabetes), we wanted to track the effect
		our care was having over time.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your interest in our medical records system.</p>
